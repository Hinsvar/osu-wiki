2. Map scoring will use Score V2.

3. The maps for each round will be announced by the mapset selectors in advance on the Sunday before the actual matches take place. Only these will be used during the respective matches.
   - There will be a [Hidden](/wiki/Game_Modifiers), [HardRock](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) and a [DoubleTime](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) bracket.
   - One map will be given as a tiebreaker map. This map will only be played in case of a tie.

4. Match schedule will be settled by the Tournament Management (see below).
5. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
6. Failed players' scores do not get added to the team score.
   - Reviving and surviving during a map is considered as passing it.

7. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable map elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
8. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the game will be nullified.
9. If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the map.
   - Disconnects within 30 seconds after map begin can be rematched. This is up to the referee's discretion. The played beatmap might be aborted for this.

10. Beatmaps cannot be reused in the same match unless the game was nullified.
11. If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes. A 'Win by default' will be declared if there isn't enough players after this deadline.
12. Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations.

14. All players are supposed to keep the match running fluent and without delays. Excessive match delays coming from the player's side can be issued with penalties.

   - Declaring the match as Lost by Default
   - Disqualification from the entire tournament

   - Any modification of these rules will be announced.

### Tournament Registration

1. Every user interested in joining their country's team signs up individually.
   - Tournament Management will create a list of potential candidates for a country's team.
   - Tournament Management declares one candidate to the captain of the country's team, albeit temporarily.
   - The declared captain can form their team from the candidate list of their country.

2. To ensure valid and serious registrations, every registered user will be checked by the Tournament Management.
   - Every registered user will be assigned to their respective country's candidate list.
   - To be successfully accepted on the list, you have to ensure that your global osu!catch performance ranking is above 5000.
